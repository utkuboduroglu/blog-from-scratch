# `blog-from-scratch`, a blog app for personal use
This is a node.js app written for the purpose of

* Learning a new programming language and testing its paradigms,
* Replacing my currently existing blog with one that properly handles math environments and (at least) commutative diagrams, which turn out to be *VERY* useful for a category theorist :)

Utilizing express.js, among other libraries, this is a simple _first_ project in Javascript. It SHOULD NOT be used in any serious capacity, as the design is still very much a work in progress.

Planning on migrating to TypeScript for more modern features.
